  CeloHT is a Haitian Web3 initiative addressing Education, Financial Inclusion, and Environmental Restoration. 
  Funding will enable transparent operations using cUSD for stable transactions and CELO for incentives, with blockchain verification for all transactions. 
  CeloHT empowers communities through blockchain education, agent-led financial services, and sustainable ecological programs.
