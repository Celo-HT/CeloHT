# CeloHT – Platform Built on CELO and cUSD
**Tagline:** Empowering the Celo ecosystem through native CELO and cUSD integration.



## Overview
CeloHT is a fully integrated platform within the **Celo ecosystem**, operating entirely with **CELO and cUSD**.  
**Important:** CeloHT is **not a token**. It does not issue or create any custom ERC-20 token. All transactions, payments, and services rely on CELO or cUSD, ensuring maximum compatibility, security, and simplicity.

CeloHT is structured around **three core pillars**:

1. **Native CELO and cUSD Transactions**  
All payments and services are conducted using CELO or cUSD. No custom token is required.

2. **Wallet Integration**  
Fully compatible with wallets such as **Valora**, **MetaMask**, **imToken**, and **Essentials**. Users can interact directly with CELO/cUSD without additional setup.

3. **dApp Integration**  
Provides APIs for dApps to connect with CeloHT backend. Ensures all transactions are conducted with CELO/cUSD for seamless integration.
