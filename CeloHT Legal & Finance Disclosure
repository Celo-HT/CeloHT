Centering the Three Core Pillars: Education • Finance • Reforestation



1. About CeloHT

CeloHT is a community-driven initiative built on three core pillars:

1) Education

Bringing blockchain, digital finance, and Web3 literacy to Haitian communities.

2) Finance

Operating a supervised community agent network that helps people access cUSD, send/receive transfers, and use non-custodial digital financial services.

3) Reforestation & Environmental Impact (ReFi)

Using blockchain transparency and community engagement to support tree-planting, environmental recovery, and climate resilience across Haiti.

These pillars define the identity, mission, and operational model of CeloHT.

3. Governance Structure

Education Board

Coordinates training, workshops, certifications, and learning resources.

Financial Operations Board

Supervises agents, coordinates compliance, ensures safe transactions, and protects users.

Reforestation & ReFi Board

Oversees tree-planting projects, environmental data collection, and blockchain-based transparency.

No individual has unilateral authority; decisions require cross-pillar approval.
