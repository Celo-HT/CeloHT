## Overview
CeloHT is a **Web3 NGO** building a sustainable ecosystem focused on:

- **Financial Education**  
- **Measurable Reforestation**  
- **Accessible Digital Payments**

All operations use **Celo cUSD via the Valora app**, ensuring transparency, stability, and accessibility.  
**CeloHT is not a token or cryptocurrency project**; its focus is on practical, real-world impact.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Financial Education
- Train community agents and users on digital finance.  
- Provide guidance on managing cUSD, using Valora, and understanding micro-transactions.  
- **Goal:** Empower communities to make informed financial decisions.  
- Track engagement with KPIs such as number of trained agents and active users.

### 2. Measurable Reforestation
- Partner with local projects to plant trees.  
- Track impact with transparent metrics:
  - Number of trees planted
  - CO₂ absorption estimates
  - Community participation rates  
- Verification: Partner with independent environmental auditors and publish quarterly reports.  
- Link financial incentives to measurable environmental outcomes.

### 3. Accessible Digital Payments
- Enable cUSD transactions via Valora for merchants and users.  
- Implement **micro-commissions** on cash-outs to sustain operations.  
- Facilitate **B2B services** and NGO partnerships for financial inclusion.  
- Backup plan: Explore additional stablecoins or payment apps if Valora faces operational issues.

## Revenue Streams

1. **Micro-Commission on Cash-Out**  
   - Small fee on withdrawals/transfers to fund operations.  
   - Forecast: At least 1,000 transactions/month needed to cover base operational costs.

2. **B2B Services**  
   - Merchant onboarding and payment solutions.  
   - NGO partnerships for finance management services.

3. **Grants and Contracts**  
   - Development grants, CSR programs, and government contracts.  
   - Reduces reliance on donations alone.

---

## Sustainability & Risk Management
- **Financial sustainability:** Monthly monitoring of transactions vs operational costs.  
- **Operational risk:** Backup solutions for payments and clear escalation protocols.  
- **Regulatory compliance:** Align with local financial regulations; maintain documentation for grants.  
- **Impact verification:** Third-party auditors for environmental projects; transparent dashboards updated quarterly.

---

## Community Explanation

### Funding Operations
- Developer salaries, agent incentives, and operational costs are covered by revenue streams.

### 12–24 Month Survival Plan

- **Stage 2 (6–12 months):** Scale services to more communities and merchants.  
- **Stage 3 (12–24 months):** Full operational self-sufficiency with validated sustainability metrics.

### Token Policy
- No CeloHT token issuance.  
- All transactions conducted in **cUSD via Valora**.
