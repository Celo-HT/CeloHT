# CeloHT Technical Paper

## 1. Introduction
CeloHT is a decentralized educational and financial inclusion initiative leveraging the Celo blockchain ecosystem. Its core mission is to empower communities through financial literacy, agent networks, and environmental impact via reforestation, using cUSD as a stable medium.



## 2. Vision & Mission
- **Vision:** Widespread financial empowerment and environmental responsibility in Haiti through blockchain-enabled solutions.  
- **Mission:**  
  1. Deliver accessible financial literacy programs.  
  2. Facilitate peer-to-peer transactions using cUSD and Valora.  
  3. Promote environmental sustainability via organized reforestation campaigns.


## 3. Core Pillars
1. **Education:**  
   - Curricula covering financial literacy, cryptocurrency basics, and investment skills.  
   - Levels structured to progress from fundamental knowledge to advanced trading and blockchain concepts.

2. **Agent Network:**  
   - Local agents facilitate P2P transactions and provide financial guidance.  
   - Agents do not hold user funds; all funds remain in users’ Valora wallets.

3. **Reforestation:**  
   - Planting programs financed through cUSD donations and community contributions.  
   - Transparent tracking of impact using blockchain-based reporting.


## 4. Technical Architecture
### 4.1 Blockchain Integration
- **Platform:** Celo  
- **Currency:** cUSD stablecoin  
- **Wallet:** Valora  
- **Interaction Model:** Non-custodial; CeloHT does not hold user funds.

### 4.2 System Components
- **Frontend:** Mobile-first interface optimized for low-bandwidth regions.  
- **Backend:** Serverless microservices for agent coordination and educational content delivery.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Optional future contracts for tracking reforestation funding, fully auditable.  
- **Data Management:** Encrypted off-chain storage for educational progress; blockchain records for financial contributions and impact metrics.

### 4.3 Security
- Users retain full control over funds (Valora custody).  
- No token issuance; no speculative assets.  
- TLS encryption for all communications; routine audits for smart contract deployments.


## 5. Operational Flow
1. Users enroll via mobile app.  
2. Users access educational modules and track progress.  
3. Users can send/receive cUSD P2P through local agents or Valora directly.
