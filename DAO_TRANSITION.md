## CeloHT 
 DAO Transition Roadmap

### Phase 1: Off-Chain Governance
- Core Committee decision-making
- Community feedback via public channels
- GitHub-based proposal tracking
Status: Active

### Phase 2: Hybrid Governance
- Snapshot or equivalent off-chain voting
- Public vote signaling
- Limited on-chain execution
Status: Planned

### Phase 3: On-Chain Governance
- Smart contract–based proposals
- On-chain voting
- Enforced execution mechanisms
Status: Future

### Requirements
- Security audits
- Legal review
- Community approval
- Clear risk disclosure

### Constraints
DAO transition will not proceed if it introduces regulatory, security, or user-risk exposure.

### Updates
Roadmap adjustments require Core Committee approval and public disclosure.
