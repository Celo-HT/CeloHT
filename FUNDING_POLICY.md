## 1. Purpose
This document defines the funding policy for **CeloHT**, ensuring all financial resources are managed responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with the organization’s three pillars: **Education, Agents, and Reforestation**, while leveraging **cUSD via Valora** for stability.

## 2. Principles
CeloHT funding is governed by the following principles:

- **Transparency**: All funding sources, allocations, and expenses are publicly documented.  
- **Accountability**: Clear records and reports ensure funds are used as intended.  
- **Mission Alignment**: Only programs that support Education, Agents, or Reforestation are funded.  
- **Non-Custodial Management**: CeloHT does not act as a bank; funds are not held as custodial assets. CeloHT facilitates fund usage via secure wallets or partner organizations.  
- **Zero Speculation**: Funds are never used for speculative investments or token trading.  
- **Risk Disclosure**: Donors acknowledge that CeloHT does not guarantee financial returns or outcomes.

## 3. Accepted Funding Sources
CeloHT may accept the following **only if they align with mission objectives**:  
- Grants  
- Donations  
- Sponsorships  

CeloHT **does NOT accept**:  
- Profit-sharing or equity capital

**No profits, dividends, or returns** are distributed to CeloHT or its team.

## 5. Fund Management
CeloHT implements strict management controls:  
- **Multisig Wallets**: Minimum 3-of-5 signatures required for transactions.  
- **Fiscal Sponsors / Partner Organizations**: External entities may assist with fund administration.  
- **Preferred Currency**: cUSD is used for transparency and stability.  

All transactions are recorded, auditable, and subject to review.

## 6. Transparency and Reporting
CeloHT ensures full reporting to stakeholders:  
- **Frequency**: Quarterly public reports and annual summaries.

- Funds remain in the control of donors or via secure wallets; CeloHT facilitates their use but never holds them as custodial assets.
