Funding Model 
 CeloHT

Overview

CeloHT operates under a non-tokenized, non-ICO, non-speculative funding model. The project does not issue a native token, does not raise funds through public sales, and does not promise financial returns. Funding is designed to ensure long-term sustainability, transparency, and regulatory safety.

The model aligns strictly with CeloHT’s three pillars:

1. Education


2. Agent Network


3. Reforestation



All financial flows are oriented toward operations, impact, and community services, not speculation.
