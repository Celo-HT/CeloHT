# CeloHT Governance

## 1. Purpose

This governance framework defines how CeloHT is managed today and how it is designed to evolve toward a decentralized governance model over time.

CeloHT is a mission-driven Web3 organization focused on:
- Financial education
- Measurable reforestation and environmental impact
- Accessible digital payments using Celo, cUSD, and the Valora app

Governance exists to protect the mission, ensure accountability, and enable progressive decentralization.



## 2. Governance Principles

CeloHT governance is guided by the following principles:

- **Transparency**: Decisions, reports, and governance changes are documented publicly.
- **Accountability**: Governance actors are accountable to the mission and the community.
- **Mission Protection**: Social and environmental impact take precedence over speculation.
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Authority is designed to move gradually from a centralized structure to a DAO-based model.
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: CeloHT adopts Celo, cUSD, and Valora as core infrastructure.



## 3. Governance Structure (Current Phase)

### 3.1 Core Team (Executor)

The Core Team is responsible for:
- Strategy and execution
- Operations and partnerships
- Financial management
- Program delivery

The Core Team acts as the initial executor of governance decisions.



### 3.2 Advisory Circle (Oversight)

The Advisory Circle:
- Provides non-binding strategic guidance
- Reviews mission alignment
- Acts as an ethical and governance safeguard

Advisors do not control funds or operations.



### 3.3 Community Layer

Community members may:
- Submit proposals
- Participate in discussions
- Contribute to education and environmental programs

Community participation is formalized through off-chain governance tools.


## 4. Decision-Making Process

### Operational Decisions
Handled by the Core Team.

### Strategic Decisions
Documented publicly and reviewed with advisors.

### Mission-Critical Decisions
Require:
- Public documentation
- Community feedback period
- Clear justification aligned with CeloHT’s mission



## 5. DAO Transition Roadmap

CeloHT governance is designed to evolve through the following phases:

### Phase 1 — Centralized Execution (Current)
- Core Team executes decisions
- Off-chain governance (GitHub, forums)

### Phase 2 — Shared Governance
- Community proposals formalized
- Multisig wallets introduced
- Advisory oversight strengthened

### Phase 3 — DAO Governance
- On-chain governance mechanisms
- Community voting
- Reduced Core Team authority
- Full transparency on treasury management

Progression between phases is documented and publicly announced.



## 6. Financial Governance

- Funds are managed transparently
- Separation between operational and program funds
- Preference for Celo-based tools (cUSD, Valora)
- Multisig treasury planned prior to DAO phase

Periodic financial summaries may be published.


## 7. Conflict of Interest

All governance participants must:
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Abstain from decisions where conflicts exist

Violations may result in removal from governance roles.



## 8. Dispute Resolution

In case of disputes:
1. Internal mediation by the Core Team
2. Advisory Circle review
3. Community disclosure if unresolved



## 9. Amendments

This governance framework may be updated to support decentralization.

Major amendments require:
- Public documentation
- Community notice
- Clear rationale



## 10. Legal and Compliance

CeloHT operates as a mission-oriented organization and complies with applicable laws.

Governance participation does not imply ownership, equity, or guaranteed financial return.



## 11. Disclaimer

CeloHT is not a speculative financial platform.
Governance exists to support education, digital payments, and measurable environmental impact.



## 12. Effective Date

This governance framework is effective upon publication and remains valid until amended.
