## CeloHT 
 Governance Framework

### 1. Principles
CeloHT governance is founded on transparency, accountability, decentralization, and community oversight.

### 2. Governance Structure

#### 2.1 Founder
The Founder defines the long-term vision, safeguards alignment with CeloHT core principles, and acts as a steward of the mission. The Founder does not exercise unilateral control over funds or protocol changes.

#### 2.2 Core Committee
The Core Committee is responsible for strategic decisions, protocol evolution, partnerships, and compliance alignment. Decisions require majority approval and are publicly recorded.

#### 2.3 Community Council
The Community Council represents contributors and users, reviews proposals, provides feedback, and ensures community perspectives are considered. Council decisions are advisory.

### 3. Decision Process
All decisions follow a standardized process: public proposal submission, committee review, community feedback period, formal committee vote, and public documentation of outcomes.

### 4. Voting Rules
Committee voting follows a one-member-one-vote model. Quorum is required for critical decisions. All votes are recorded and non-anonymous.

### 5. Conflict Resolution
Conflicts are addressed through internal mediation, committee review, and Founder arbitration as a final measure.

### 6. Transparency
CeloHT commits to open governance documentation, public GitHub repositories, auditable decision records, and financial transparency reporting.

### 7. Governance Evolution
CeloHT may progressively adopt on-chain voting, DAO-based governance, or smart-contract–enforced mechanisms. Any transition requires public documentation and formal approval.

### 8. Amendments
Amendments to this framework require a public proposal, committee approval, and public disclosure.
