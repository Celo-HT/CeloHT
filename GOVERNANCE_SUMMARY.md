## Governance Philosophy
CeloHT follows a community-first, transparency-driven governance model aligned with its three pillars: Education, Agents, and Reforestation.

## Decision-Making
Governance relies on core contributors for coordination, open community feedback, and publicly documented decisions. No single individual has unilateral control over funds or strategy.

## Transparency Mechanisms
CeloHT maintains open repositories, written policies, and clear reporting on funding usage and program outcomes.

## Funds Oversight
Funds are subject to documented approval processes. Preference is given to multisig control or third-party custody. Conflicts of interest are disclosed.

## Governance Evolution
- Phase 0: Community coordination  
- Phase 1: Structured roles and agent programs  
- Phase 2: Formal governance layer (DAO or legal entity)
