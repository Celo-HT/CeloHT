## Mission & Core Pillars
CeloHT is a community-led, non-profit-oriented initiative built **strictly** on three foundational pillars:

1. **Education** – financial literacy, digital finance education, and responsible use of Web3 tools  
2. **Agents** – community-based facilitators enabling access and onboarding  
3. **Reforestation** – community-driven environmental impact initiatives

All CeloHT activities must align with at least one of these pillars and must never contradict them.


## Use of the Celo Ecosystem (Celo, cUSD, Valora)
CeloHT uses the **Celo blockchain ecosystem solely as public, open infrastructure**.

### cUSD
- Used as a **stable digital currency** for education, peer-to-peer community payments, and impact-related activities
- cUSD is **not issued, managed, guaranteed, or controlled** by CeloHT

### Valora
- Used as a **non-custodial wallet application**
- Users retain exclusive control of their private keys and funds at all times
- CeloHT does not access, store, recover, or operate user wallets

### Celo (Gas)
- Used only to pay required blockchain transaction fees
- CeloHT does not intermediate or manage gas usage


## Role of Agents P2P facilitation
Agents are **independent community facilitators**, not financial service providers.

Agents **may**:
- Educate users on using Valora
- Facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges where users bring physical cash voluntarily
- Guide users to send or receive **cUSD via their own Valora wallets**
- Verify transactions on-chain and assist users in the process
- Collect **small voluntary service fees** if agreed between user and agent (not retained by CeloHT)

Agents **may not**:
- Custody or pool user funds
- Execute transactions on behalf of users
- Access private keys or recovery phrases
- Operate as a bank, MSB, or remittance service
- Advertise or operate an official money transfer service

All blockchain transactions are executed **directly by users** using non-custodial wallets.


## What CeloHT Is
CeloHT is:
- A community initiative
- An education, access, and environmental impact layer
- Non-custodial by design
- **Tokenless** (no native or issued token)
- Open-source oriented



## What CeloHT Is Not
CeloHT is not:
- A bank, custodial wallet, payment processor, or remittance service
- An investment fund, broker, or asset manager
- A token issuer, seller
- A profit-distribution organization

CeloHT does **not**:
- Hold or control user funds
- Guarantee transactions or outcomes
- Promise financial returns
- Provide financial, legal, tax, or investment advice
- Conduct ICOs, IDOs, token sales, or speculative activities



## Future Development (Legal-Safe Forward Looking Statement)
CeloHT may, in the future, **explore the development of a non-custodial decentralized application (dApp)** aligned strictly with its three core pillars:

1. Education
2. Agents (Ajan)
3. Reforestation (Rebwazman)

Any such dApp would:
- Be built on the **Celo blockchain**
- Use **cUSD** as a stable digital asset
- Interoperate with **Valora** via non-custodial mechanisms (deep links or wallet connections)
- Require users to retain full control of their wallets and private keys
- Facilitate **peer-to-peer cash-to-cUSD and cUSD-to-cash exchanges** via community agents, for educational or community purposes only

This future development is:
- **Exploratory and non-binding**
- **Subject to technical, regulatory, and operational constraints**
- **Not a commitment to launch, availability, or functionality**

CeloHT will not, through any future dApp:
- Provide custodial services
- Operate as a bank,
- Hold, manage, or intermediate user funds
- Guarantee returns, rewards, or financial outcomes



## Alignment with the Three Pillars

### Education
- All activities are educational and informational
- No certification or professional advice is implied

### Agents
- Agents act strictly as facilitators, not service providers
- No authority to bind CeloHT legally or financially

### Reforestation
- Environmental actions are community-led
- No carbon credits, offsets, or financial returns are guaranteed



## Risk Disclosure
Participation involves inherent risks, including:
- Blockchain and smart contract vulnerabilities
- User error (loss of private keys, incorrect transfers)
- Infrastructure risks related to cUSD and the Celo network
- Regulatory uncertainty depending on jurisdiction

Users and agents assume full responsibility for their actions.
