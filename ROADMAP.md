# CeloHT Roadmap

CeloHT is a **non-custodial**, **non-speculative**, **no-token** Web3 initiative built on three core pillars:
**Education · Community Agents · Reforestation**, leveraging **Celo cUSD** and **Valora** strictly as voluntary settlement tools.

CeloHT does **not** issue tokens, conduct ICOs, or provide financial services.
