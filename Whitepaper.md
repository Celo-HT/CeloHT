# CELOHT  
## Building Open Digital Financial Infrastructure for Underserved Communities



## Executive Summary

CeloHT is a non-custodial Web3 infrastructure initiative focused on **financial education**, **accessible stable digital payments**, and **verifiable environmental impact** in underserved communities, starting in Haiti and expanding across the Caribbean.

CeloHT does not issue tokens, does not custody user funds, and does not operate as a regulated financial institution. It functions as an **open, educational, and infrastructural layer** built on the Celo blockchain, prioritizing transparency, sustainability, and real-world utility.


## 1. Problem Statement

In Haiti and much of the Caribbean:

- Over **60% of adults are unbanked or underbanked**

- Average remittance costs range between **6% and 10%**

- Financial literacy related to digital finance remains limited

- Environmental initiatives often lack transparency and long-term monitoring

These challenges are structural and long-term. They require **infrastructure and education**, not speculative financial products.



## 2. The CeloHT Solution

CeloHT addresses these challenges through three integrated pillars.



### 2.1 Financial Education

CeloHT delivers practical education covering:
- Digital wallets and self-custody
- Stablecoin usage
- Personal finance fundamentals
- Introductory Web3 concepts with real-world relevance

Delivery methods:
- Community workshops
- Digital learning materials
- Local ambassadors and trainers

**Key metrics:**
- Number of participants trained
- Wallets created post-training
- Retention rate after 3–6 months



### 2.2 Accessible Digital Payments

CeloHT enables stable digital payments through:
- **cUSD** on the Celo blockchain
- Mobile-first wallets such as **Valora**
- Near-instant settlement
- Low transaction fees (typically below $0.05)

**Core principle:**  
CeloHT never holds user funds and does not intermediate transactions.


### 2.3 Measurable Environmental Impact

CeloHT supports reforestation initiatives using:
- Partner-led tree planting programs
- Transparent, public reporting
- Long-term monitoring

**Impact methodology:**
- Tree counts recorded per project
- CO₂ estimates based on **IPCC average sequestration models**  
  Source: IPCC Assessment Reports (AR6)  
  https://www.ipcc.ch
- Geographic tagging
- Lifecycle monitoring

**Tracked indicators:**
- Trees planted
- Estimated CO₂ offset (non-tradable)
- Project status updates

No carbon credits are issued or sold.
