Why CeloHT Conducts No ICO

CeloHT has never conducted and will never conduct an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

This is a deliberate and irreversible decision.



1. No Token, Therefore No ICO

An ICO exists only to sell a token.

CeloHT:

issues no token

sells no digital asset

promises no financial return


Without a token, an ICO is structurally impossible.



2. Protection of the Public

ICOs expose the public to:

speculative risk

misleading expectations

potential financial loss


CeloHT refuses to place users or supporters in a position of financial risk.




3. Legal and Regulatory Responsibility

In many jurisdictions, ICOs may be classified as securities offerings.

By conducting no ICO:

no securities exposure

no investor regulation burden

no cross-border compliance conflicts


CeloHT remains legally neutral and globally accessible.


4. Mission Integrity

CeloHT exists to support:

Education

Local Economic Agents

Reforestation


An ICO would shift focus from impact to capital raising.

CeloHT prioritizes impact over fundraising.




5. Security and Risk Reduction

Fundraising mechanisms introduce:

custody risk

attack incentives

governance pressure


CeloHT holds no raised capital and manages no investor funds.

This dramatically lowers technical and operational risk.




6. Alignment with Serious Global Projects

Many respected initiatives operate without ICOs:

open-source foundations

public-interest infrastructures

academic and non-profit platforms


CeloHT follows this model.




Final Declaration

CeloHT is not an investment product.

CeloHT does not:

raise funds via ICO

sell tokens

solicit investors


CeloHT is a public-interest Web3 platform, not a fundraising vehicle.



CeloHT Transparency. Responsibility. Long-term trust.
