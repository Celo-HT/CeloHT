# Alternative Governance Model

## 1. Governance Structure

### A. Multisig Contract
- **Description:** All key operations (fund transfers, financial management, contract deployment) go through a multisig contract.  
- **Parameters:**
  - Total signers: 5  
  - Required signatures for approval: 3  
- **Benefits:** Reduces risk of abuse, increases security, and ensures decisions are made by consensus.

### B. Governance Council
- **Structure:**
  - Members: 7 (3 founders + 4 independent/community members)  
  - Term: 1 year, renewable  
- **Responsibilities:**
  1. Approve major deployments and new features  
  2. Review financial reports and activity  
  3. Recommend ecosystem improvements  
  4. Ensure compliance with international regulations (e.g., KYC/AML when necessary)

### C. Council Rules
- **Meetings:** Mandatory monthly, virtual or physical  
- **Voting:** Simple majority (50% +1) for general decisions; 2/3 majority for major financial decisions  
- **Communication:** All meetings documented and published on a GitHub repo or transparency portal



## 2. Transparency Rules
1. **Financial Reporting:** Quarterly reports on fund transactions, operational expenses, and fund reserves  
2. **Development & Updates:** All new deployments or change proposals must be public with a 7-day community review period  
3. **Audits:** Independent audits of code and finances annually  
4. **Community Portal:** Members can access council decisions, multisig documents, and project development plans



## 3. Internal Control Mechanisms
- **Proposals:** Any member can submit a proposal to the council or multisig  
- **Voting:** Financial proposals > $50,000 require 2/3 council approval + multisig authorization  
- **Member Removal:** Members violating ethical or security rules can be removed by 2/3 council vote


## 4. Model Advantages
- **Security:** Multisig contracts prevent unilateral actions  
- **Transparency:** All decisions and transactions are public and auditable  
- **Accountability:** Council roles and responsibilities are clearly defined  
- **Flexibility:** Adaptable to new members or updated regulations
