# CeloHT DAO Constitution

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this constitution is to define the rules, rights, and responsibilities of participants in the CeloHT DAO.  

It ensures that CeloHT’s mission remains protected:
- Financial education
- Measurable reforestation and environmental impact
- Accessible digital payments using Celo, cUSD, and the Valora app

This constitution governs how decisions are made, how funds are used, and how the community participates in a decentralized manner.

## 2. Guiding Principles

1. **Mission First**: All DAO actions must support CeloHT’s three core pillars.  
2. **Transparency**: All proposals, votes, and treasury movements are publicly documented.  
3. **Accountability**: Participants are accountable for their roles and actions.  
4. **Security**: Multisig and DAO smart contract controls protect funds.  
5. **Progressive Decentralization**: Authority transfers gradually from the Core Team to the DAO.  
6. **Ecosystem Alignment**: All operations prioritize Celo-native infrastructure (Celo, cUSD, Valora).
