# CeloHT DAO Transition Framework

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how CeloHT transitions from a centralized execution model to decentralized governance (DAO), without compromising its mission.

The transition prioritizes:
- Financial education
- Measurable reforestation and environmental impact
- Accessible digital payments using Celo, cUSD, and the Valora app

Decentralization is a tool, not a goal in itself.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Mission First**: The three pillars cannot be overridden by governance mechanics.
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Authority shifts gradually, not abruptly.
- **Transparency**: Every phase and change is documented publicly.
- **Security**: Funds and operations remain protected throughout the transition.
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: Governance tools favor Celo-native infrastructure.

---

## 3. Current State (Pre-DAO)

- Governance executed by the Core Team
- Advisory Circle provides oversight
- Community participation is consultative
- Treasury managed via multisig
- Off-chain governance (GitHub, discussions)

This phase ensures stability and execution capacity.

---

## 4. Transition Phases

### Phase 1 — Structured Centralization (Active)
- Core Team executes decisions
- Proposal framework active
- Multisig treasury in place
- Public documentation required for key decisions

**Exit criteria**:
- Stable operations
- Transparent treasury history
- Active community engagement

---

### Phase 2 — Shared Governance
- Formal community proposals enabled
- Advisory Circle oversight strengthened
- Multisig expanded to include non-core signers
- Regular public financial summaries

**Exit criteria**:
- Consistent proposal flow
- Community participation quality
- Operational readiness for on-chain tools

---

### Phase 3 — DAO Activation
- On-chain governance introduced
- Community voting enabled (tokenless or token-based)
- Treasury execution linked to governance outcomes
- Core Team authority reduced to execution role

**Conditions**:
- Legal and compliance review
- Security audits where applicable
- Clear community communication

## 5. Governance Powers by Phase

| Function              | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Strategy              | Core    | Shared  | DAO     |
| Treasury Execution    | Multisig| Multisig| DAO     |
| Proposal Approval     | Core    | Shared  | DAO     |

---

## 6. Treasury Evolution

- cUSD remains the primary operational currency
- CELO used for ecosystem participation and fees
- Multisig remains active until DAO execution is secure
- No speculative asset management

Treasury transparency is mandatory in all phases.

---

## 7. Legal and Compliance Considerations

- DAO transition does not imply profit distribution
- No automatic ownership or equity rights
- Compliance with applicable local regulations
- DAO tooling selected to minimize legal risk

---

## 8. Risk Management

Identified risks:
- Governance capture
- Low-quality participation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Mission drift

Mitigation:
- Gradual authority transfer
- Advisory oversight
- Multisig safeguards
- Clear rejection criteria for proposals

---

## 9. Community Role

Community members may:
- Propose initiatives
- Participate in governance discussions
- Vote during DAO phase
- Monitor impact and accountability

Participation does not guarantee financial return.

---

## 10. Amendments

This transition framework may be updated if:
- Mission alignment is preserved
- Changes are documented publicly
- Community is informed in advance

---

## 11. Disclaimer

CeloHT is not a speculative DAO.
Governance exists to support education, digital payments, and measurable environmental impact.

---

## 12. Effective Date

This DAO transition framework is effective upon publication and remains valid until amended.
