# CeloHT Multisig Treasury Framework

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how CeloHT manages its treasury using a multisignature (multisig) wallet to ensure transparency, security, and accountability.

The multisig treasury exists to protect funds dedicated to:
- Financial education
- Measurable reforestation and environmental impact
- Accessible digital payments using Celo, cUSD, and the Valora app



## 2. Why Multisig

CeloHT adopts a multisig treasury to:
- Reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- Prevent unilateral fund control
- Align with international Web3 governance standards
- Prepare for future DAO governance



## 3. Treasury Assets

The CeloHT treasury may hold:
- **cUSD** (primary operational and program currency)
- **CELO** (ecosystem alignment, fees, and governance-related usage)

No speculative assets are held by default.



## 4. Multisig Configuration

- **Network**: Celo blockchain
- **Wallet Type**: Multisignature smart contract wallet
- **Signature Threshold**: *M-of-N* (example: 3-of-5)
- **Signers**: Trusted individuals aligned with CeloHT’s mission

Exact addresses and parameters are documented publicly.



## 5. Signer Roles and Responsibilities

Multisig signers must:
- Act in the best interest of CeloHT
- Protect the mission and funds
- Review transactions carefully before signing
- Disclose conflicts of interest

Signers do **not** own treasury funds.



## 6. Signer Selection

Signers may include:
- Core Team representatives
- Independent advisors
- Trusted community-aligned contributors

No single entity may control a majority of signatures.



## 7. Transaction Categories

### Operational Transactions
- Education programs
- Platform costs
- Outreach and community initiatives

### Program Transactions
- Reforestation activities
- Environmental impact measurement
- Community incentives using cUSD

### Strategic Transactions
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Governance tooling
- DAO transition preparation

All transactions must align with CeloHT’s mission.



## 8. Approval Process

1. Transaction proposal is documented
2. Signers review purpose and amount
3. Required signatures are collected
4. Transaction is executed on-chain
5. Record is stored publicly



## 9. Transparency and Reporting

CeloHT commits to:
- Public visibility of treasury addresses
- On-chain traceability of transactions
- Periodic financial summaries



## 10. Security Practices

- Signers must use secure wallets
- Private keys must not be shared
- Emergency procedures may be triggered if a signer is compromised



## 11. Removal or Replacement of Signers

A signer may be removed if:
- They violate governance principles
- They act against CeloHT’s mission
- They become inactive or unreachable

Removal requires multisig approval and public documentation.



## 12. DAO Transition Readiness

The multisig treasury is designed to evolve into:
- Community-influenced approvals
- On-chain governance execution
- Reduced Core Team control

This transition will be documented transparently.



## 13. Legal Disclaimer

Participation as a multisig signer does not grant ownership, equity, or guaranteed financial return.



## 14. Effective Date

This multisig framework is effective upon publication and remains valid until amended.
