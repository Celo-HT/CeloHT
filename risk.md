# CeloHT Risk Assessment

## 1. Regulatory and Legal Risks
- **Compliance Uncertainty:** Laws around crypto, digital wallets, and NGOs vary by country. CeloHT must ensure compliance in Haiti and internationally.
- **Licensing:** Any financial services (cUSD, Valora integration) require proper licenses.
- **Taxation:** Potential tax obligations for users and the NGO must be clarified.
- **AML/KYC:** Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures need implementation to avoid legal issues.

## 2. Financial Risks
- **Volatility of Celo and cUSD:** While cUSD is stable, the Celo token may fluctuate, impacting funding.
- **Funding Dependence:** If reliant on grants or donations, financial sustainability could be at risk.
- **Micro-transaction Model:** Cash-out fees or service fees must balance sustainability with user affordability.

## 3. Operational Risks

## 4. Community and Adoption Risks
